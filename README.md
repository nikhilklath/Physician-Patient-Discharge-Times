# Physician-Patient-Discharge-Times
Physicians work in shifts, in which they begin work at a set time and stay until they discharge their patients (usually past the end of shift). Patients arrive and are immediately assigned to a physician, unless if the physician has not started his or her shift yet. In the latter case, the patient is assigned to the physician at the beginning of the shift. 

This do file creates a “census,” or number of patients under a physician’s care (patients who have arrived and have not yet been discharged), during each hour of a physician’s shift from beginning to 4 hours past the end of shift.
